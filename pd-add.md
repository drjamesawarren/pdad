Dear Colleague

NIST, in coordination with the University of Maryland, is seeking to
fill a post-doctoral position with an outstanding candidate. This
research position will extend and enhance the tools that NIST is
developing to establish the infrastructure needed to achieve the goals
set out in the Administration's Materials Genome
Initiative. Specifically, the qualified candidate should have a record
of developing and implementing numerical models that link materials
processing and microstructure (such as phase field, level set, or
related methods) into research codes (preferably
open-source). Furthermore, the candidate should have an interest in
data science tools and techniques that can relate materials structure
and properties. This effort will entail the identification and
development of concepts in microstructure informatics and machine
learning and then integrating these approaches into (i) the
scikit-learn framework, (ii) the NIST data/model repository
infrastructure, and (iii) the NIST developed FiPy software.
